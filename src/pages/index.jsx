      <h2>Made with care by Dorothy in Atlanta, Ga.</h2>
      <p>All of my quilts are made with top quality, 100% cotton materials, machine pieced by me with all the care and skill I can bring
                to each project. The most important thing to me is for you to be happy with your finished product. All quilts, except for small projects,
                are Long Arm Quilted by my close friend Glenna Ann Bowmaster of Fine Feathers Quilting. She works her magic, then I do the finish work.
