            <p>Whether there is a quilt design out there that you love or you want a one of a kind quilt, I can work with you to make it perfect. Quilts make a special gift for wedding or new baby, or a throw quilt to add to the d√©cor of a room. Many of these quilts were made for my family, and your family will enjoy the same quality and care that they are made with.</p>            <DesignedCarousel />
